# SecurityRequirement
Categorization, Prioritization, and Summarization of Security Vulnerabilities or Weaknesses

# Project Description
An system leveraging SecureBERT to analyze security vulnerabilities by:

- Categorizing the type of vulnerability
- Assigning priority levels
- Providing structured analysis of security weaknesses (by using summarization model or any LLM model)

# Overview

Base Model: Fine-tuned SecureBERT for security domain understanding
Categorization: Classification of vulnerability types
Prioritization: Assignment of priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
Architecture: Extending SecureBERT based model and neural network with multiple classification heads
